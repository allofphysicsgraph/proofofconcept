    Based on work in <a href="http://bhpayne.github.io/family_tree/">bhpayne family tree</a> in which I built a force directed graph with pictures. Here pictures are not set by d3js<BR>
    Status: works as desired.

    Same as 10, but with properly sized pictures. Ran the "file" command in linux against each png file to determine dimensions. These dimensions are then included in the JSON<BR>
    Status: works as desired.

    Same as 11, but here the index is included in the JSON as text<BR>

    Full graph, too dense to interpret visually or manipulate. There is a clear need for better approaches to the visualization.<BR>
    Status: broken.
