<P><i>Objective for this project:</i> Write down all known mathematical physics in a way that can be both read by humans and checked by a computer algebra system.<BR>
[To view the current state, see this <a href="site/overview.html">overview graph</a> and this <a href="site/derivations.html">listing of content</a>.]
</P>
  
<P><i>Example:</i> A simple example is the relation between period, <i>T</i>, and linear frequency, <i>f</i>. The mathematical expression of the relation is <i>T=1/f</i>. To express frequency as a function of period, multiply both sides of the expression by <i>f</i> to get a new expression, <i>T*f=1</i>. Finally, divide both sides of the second expression by <i>T</i> to yield the third expression, <i>f=1/T</i>.

<P>In this example, there are three expressions. Each expression is defined by a left-hand side, a relation operator (here "="), and a right-hand side. Two instances of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation#Definition">Equivalence relation</a> relate the three expressions. These relations between expressions are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rules_of_inference">inference rules</a>. The generic form of the first inference rule used in the example is "multiply both sides of an expression by a quantity to yield a new expression." Similarly, the second inference rule is generically, "divide both sides of an expression by a quantity to yield a new expression."

<div style="border: 2px solid darkblue; padding: 5px;" id="area1"></div>
</P>

<P>The central database for documenting relations in derivations of Physics is a <a href="site/example_T_f/example_T_f_csv.html">CSV</a>. This can be transformed into other formats: <a href="site/example_T_f_networkx.html">Networkx</a>, <a href="site/example_T_f/example_T_f_mathematica.html">Mathematica</a>, <a href="site/example_T_f/example_T_f_graphml.html">GraphML</a>, <a href="site/example_T_f/example_T_f_dot.html">GraphViz</a>, <a href="site/example_T_f/example_T_f_json.html">JSON</a>, and <a href="site/example_T_f/example_T_f_tex.html">LaTeX</a>. Most are lossy -- they don't contain all the data present in the original CSV. </P>

<P><i>Motivation:</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics">Mathematical Physics</a> uses the tools of math applied to measurements of our environment. I claim Physics is a unique field in that all existing knowledge can be recorded. Another aspect that is unique is that the result can be checked for correctness by a computer algebra system. A third unique facet to Physics is that claims can be tested by experiment.</P>

<P>No new research in math or physics is needed to validate these claims. This project documents the relations between derivations used to describe physical experiments.</P>


<P>Derivations used in Physics are mathematical expressions linked by a finite set of inference rules. From this observation, a few claims can be made.
<UL>
  <LI>A finite static graph exists which relates all expressions of mathematical physics. In this graph, nodes are expressions and edges are inference rules.</LI>
  <LI>A finite number of unique inference rules are needed to express the relations between expressions.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>The Physics Derivation Graph does not include geometric arguments</p>

<P>The Physics Derivation Graph does not include textual explanations about why algebraic manipulations are being carried out.</p>

<P>The Physics Derivation Graph is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaum%27s_Outlines">Schuam's outline</a>, except it covers all known Physics and documents the relations between various governing expressions.<BR>

<p>There are no automatic mechanisms for generating new content.<BR>

<p>There are no new algorithms. The Physics Derivation Graph is about documenting existing knowledge.</P>

<P>The Physics Derivation Graph does include boundary conditions and initial conditions.
