<P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics">Mathematical Physics</a> uses the tools of math applied to measurements of our environment. 

<P>A simple example is the relation between period, <i>T</i>, and linear frequency, <i>f</i>. The mathematical expression of the relation is <i>T=1/f</i>. To express frequency as a function of period, multiply both sides of the expression by <i>f</i> to get a new expression, <i>T*f=1</i>. Finally, divide both sides of the second expression by <i>T</i> to yield the third expression, <i>f=1/T</i>.

<P>In this example, there are three expressions. Each expression is defined by a left-hand side, a relation operator (here "="), and a right-hand side. Two instances of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation#Definition">Equivalence relation</a> relate the three expressions. These relations between expressions are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rules_of_inference">inference rules</a>. The generic form of the first inference rule used in the example is "multiply both sides of an expression by a quantity to yield a new expression." Similarly, the second inference rule is generically, "divide both sides of an expression by a quantity to yield a new expression."

<P>Derivations used in Physics are mathematical expressions linked by a finite set of inference rules. From this observation, a few claims can be made.</P>

This project documents the relations between derivations used to describe physical experiments.</P>
