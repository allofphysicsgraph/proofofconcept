#Rough Draft
From my understanding most of mathematics can be derived from Peano axioms, ZFC set theory and serveral variants of similar systems that pick and choose the nuances
of their system.

The thing that these logical systems have in common is that they start with a very small set of building blocks and from there can create incredibly complex systems.

Build up the natural numbers, the notion of order, equivalence, operators,....

My claim is that any derivation in the PDG could be reduced to a number of operations from a logical system such as Dedekindâ€“Peano axioms.

The symbols and tools that are dervied from the axiomatic systems are abstraction layers which make it convenient to think about difficult problems,
but there still has to be one or more paths from the axioms to the derivations.

Understanding those paths and having the abililty to navigate them systematically would significantly improve my problem solving abilities.
