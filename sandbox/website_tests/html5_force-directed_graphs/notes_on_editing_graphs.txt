Both g.ivank.net and gleap.org demonstrate dynamic html5 graphs with user interactivity.
Neither are exactly what I want (node labels, zooming interface), but are much closer than starting from scratch.

g.ivank.net is vastly superior compared to gleap.org. 
-gleap.org allows user to add nodes. However, the nodes are randomly connected
-gleap.org allows a statically-set maximum number of nodes (75, set in)
-gleap.org does not allow user to drag nodes around
-gleap.org does not give 3D view

-g.ivank.net allows user to alter connection strength; distance between nodes is on a slider (compressibility)
-g.ivank.net allows user to specify which nodes are connected
-g.ivank.net allows labels to be shown (node index)
-g.ivank.net allows 3D and 2D views of the graph
-g.ivank.net allows user to drag graph around canvas

*********************
so what do I want to add to the g.ivank.net canvas?
-node labels as a static array [done 20121030]
-replace circles as nodes with boxes of proper size
   -need trapezoids for operators
-replace lines with arrows: it is a directed graph
-replace circles as nodes with pictures (png or svg?)
-node labels should be supplied by user through web interface?
-buttons on web interface to export labels, export connections to file
-ability to read/write connections list from file rather than URL or text box
-add,remove nodes; add, remove edges
-add descriptors for clusters of nodes

so we need a list of nodes and a list of how the nodes are connected

node 1e: equation blah blah
node 2e: equation this one
node 3e: equation another

node 1o: operator do a to b
node 2o: operator add 0 to a

connections: 1e-1o, 1o-2e, 2e-2o, 2o-3e

[v optional v]
-I'm not clear on the difference between "repulsion" and "attraction" knob
   -it would be useful to have "+" and "-" signs on either side of the sliders
   -click on the "repulsion" and "attraction" knobs should not break the rendering
-canvas should have a clear boarder
-it might be useful to dynamically display graph parameters for troubleshooting
-zoom in and out of graph [+/-] sign on slider AND mouse web wheel
-collapse node connections when zooming out; replace solid lines with dashed lines to signify missing nodes


*********************
details of the g.ivank.net canvas:
-colors of the nodes are set by
c.setAttribute("fill"
in Control.js

-text of the nodes is set by
t.textContent
in Control.js

-the two sliders are declared as
new Slider('repSL'
new Slider('attSL'
in Control.js
