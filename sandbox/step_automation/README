when converting a derivation from paper to the PDG, the basic unit is the step.
A step either
* relates one set of expressions to another through an inference rule
* designates a start
* designates a termination


decision tree

do you want to 
* start a new derivation?
  # set name of derivation
  # step 1: declare an initial equation
  # step n - see function
  # add another step || exit derivation?
* edit an existing derivation?
  # which exiting derivation?
  # which step
* exit


function: step n
# choose inference rule
# for this inference rule
# if appropriate, input
  * choose input expression from expressions in this derivation
  * choose input expression from all PDG
  * provide new expression
# if appropriate, provide feed
# if appropriate, output
  * provide new expression
  * choose input expression from expressions in this derivation
  * choose input expression from all PDG
