<P>Question: derive the wave function for a quantum particle in a 1D box

    <td>ChatGPT 3.5</td> <!-- LLM -->
    <td>Sure, let's break down the proof step by step.

<P>In Lean, you would typically use tactics to prove a theorem. The goal is to show that if `a = b`, then `a + 2 = b + 2`.

<P>Here's a possible proof in Lean:

<pre>
```lean
import data.real.basic

-- Assume a, b are real numbers
variables (a b : ℝ)

-- Assume the proposition a = b
variable h : a = b

-- To prove a + 2 = b + 2, add
-- 2 to both sides of the
-- equation a = b
example : a + 2 = b + 2 :=
begin
  -- Use the tactic rw (rewrite)
  -- to substitute a = b in
  -- the goal
  rw h,

  -- Use the tactic ring to
  -- simplify the goal using
  -- the properties of
  -- the real numbers
  ring,
end
```
</pre>

<P>Let me explain the steps:

<P>1. `import data.real.basic`: This imports the basic properties of real numbers in Lean.<BR>
2. `variables (a b : ℝ)`: This declares `a` and `b` as real numbers.<BR>
3. `variable h : a = b`: This declares `h` as the hypothesis that `a = b`.<BR>
4. `example : a + 2 = b + 2 :=`: This sets up the goal to prove `a + 2 = b + 2`.<BR>
5. `rw h`: This uses the `rw` tactic to rewrite the goal using the hypothesis `a = b`.<BR>
6. `ring`: This uses the `ring` tactic to simplify the goal using the properties of the real numbers.

<P>So, the proof in Lean is essentially showing that if `a = b`, then you can add 2 to both sides to get `a + 2 = b + 2`.</td> <!-- response -->

<p>Question: What mathematical expressions are present in the following Latex?

<pre>```
Several notable properties of condensed
 matter phases are defined by fundamental
 physical constants. The Bohr radius gives
 a characteristic scale of interatomic
 distance on the order of the Angstrom,
 in terms of electron mass $m_e$, charge
 $e$, and Planck constant $\hbar$. These
 same fundamental constants enter the
 Rydberg energy, setting the scale of a
 characteristic bonding energy in condensed
 phases and chemical compounds
 \cite{ashcroft}.

Among the fundamental constants, those
 that are {\it dimensionless} and do
 not depend on the choice of units, play
  a special role in physics \cite{barrow}.
  Two important dimensionless constants
  are the fine structure constant $\alpha$
  and the proton-to-electron mass ratio,
  $\frac{m_p}{m_e}$. The finely-tuned
  values of $\alpha$ and $\frac{m_p}{m_e}$,
  and the balance between them, governs
  nuclear reactions such as proton decay
  and nuclear synthesis in stars, leading
  to the creation of the essential
  biochemical elements, including carbon.
  This balance provides a narrow
  ``habitable zone'' in the
  ($\alpha$,$\frac{m_p}{m_e}$) space
  where stars and planets can form and
  life-supporting molecular structures
  can emerge \cite{barrow}.

We show that a simple combination of
 $\alpha$ and $\frac{m_p}{m_e}$
 results in another dimensionless
 quantity which has an unexpected
 and specific implication for a key
 property of condensed phases, the
 speed at which waves travel in solids
 and liquids, or the speed of sound,
 $v$. We find that this combination
 provides an upper bound for $v$, $v_u$, as
\begin{equation}
\frac{v_u}{c}=\alpha\left(\frac{m_e}{2m_p}
\right)^{\frac{1}{2}},
\label{v0}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $c$ is the speed
of light in vacuum.

We support this result with a large
set of experimental data for different
systems, and the first principles
modelling of atomic hydrogen.

Identifying and understanding bounds
 on physical properties is important
 from the point of view of fundamental
 physics, predictions for theory and
 experiment, as well as searching for
 and rationalizing universal behavior
 (see, e.g., \cite{kss,zaanen3,hartnoll,
zaanen2,spin,behnia,zaanen1,behnia1,
hartnoll1}). Properties for which
bounds were recently discussed include
viscosity and diffusivity. The
proposed {\it lower} bounds for
these two properties feature in a
range of areas including, for example,
strongly-interacting field theories,
quark-gluon plasmas, holographic
duality, electron diffusion, transport
properties in metals and superconductors,
and spin transport in Fermi gases
\cite{kss,zaanen3,hartnoll,zaanen2,
  spin,behnia,zaanen1,behnia1,hartnoll1}.
  Recently, two of us found a lower
  bound for the kinematic viscosity of
  liquids set by fundamental physical
  constants \cite{sciadv}. Here, we
  propose a new, {\it upper}, bound
  for the speed of sound in condensed
  matter phases in terms of
  fundamental constants.

Apart from setting the speed of elastic
 interactions in solids, $v$ is related
 to elasticity, hardness and affects
 important low-temperature
 thermodynamic properties such as
 energy, entropy and heat capacity
 \cite{landau}. As discussed below,
 the upper bound of $v$ sets the smallest
possible entropy and heat capacity
at a given temperature.

In solids, $v$ depends on elastic
properties and density. These strongly
 depend on the bonding type and
 structure which are inter-dependent
 \cite{phillips}. As a result, it
 was not thought that $v$ can be
 predicted analytically without
 simulations, contrary to other
 properties such as energy or heat
 capacity which are universal in the
 classical harmonic approximation
 \cite{landau}. In view of this,
 representing the upper bound of
 $v$ in terms of fundamental constants
 is notable.
