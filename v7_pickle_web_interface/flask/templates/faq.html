  <a name="durability of project ">
    <em>What is the durability of the project?</em>
  </a><BR/>
  Many projects in knowledge management of science last as long as a grant or are created in support of a publication.
  The Physics Derivation Grpah is hosted on DigitalOcean using a single droplet at a cost of $60/year.
  As of August 2020, the account has $63 available (so at least another year).
  The lease on the domain name through Google is $12/year and renews annually.

<!-- <H3>Scope and Definitions</H3> -->
  <a name="define inference rule">
  <P><em>What is an inference rule?</em>
  </a><BR/>
  An inference rule is the atomic step of logic that relates two mathematical expressions. See the full explanation <a href="{{ url_for('user_documentation') }}?referrer=faq#inference rules">in the documentation</a>.
<P>

<HR/> <!-- ************************************************** -->
<P>
  <a name="generate output from inference rule">
    <em>Why does the user provide the input expressions, inference rule, and outputs? Why not generate the output from the inputs + inference rule?</em>
  </a><BR/>
    In principle this is feasible in the Physics Derivation Graph.Â 
    With the user providing the input expressions and inference rules (plus any needed arguments), the outputs are deterministic.
    For example, starting with the expression
    \begin{equation}
a = b
\end{equation}
the user instructs the software to apply the inference rule "multiply both sides by x" where \(x=2\).
Then the software produces the output
\begin{equation}
2 a = 2 b
\end{equation}
The constraint is that the Computer Algebra System used in the PDG (SymPy) is not capable of handling all inference rules or all expressions.
Currently in the Physics Derivation Graph the user provides Latex, which gets converted (with help from the user) to SymPy.
SymPy may eventually have the capability of deterministically applying inference rules.
That would require investment in the Latex parser and Physics libraries.

    <em>Is the Physics Derivation Graph just knowledge management?</em>

<P>
  The Physics Derivation Graph is enabled by sementic decoration of symbols and expressions.
  The implementation uses Sympy as a Computer Algebra System and extensive numeric indices for symbols, expressions, and steps.

  <a name="grandiose">
    <em>Why would the Physics Derivation Graph succeed where other projects have stagnated?</em>
  </a><BR/>
  This question is motivated by the essay <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/openmathcrit.pdf">"A Critique of OpenMath and Thoughts on Encoding Mathematics"</a> (2001) since the Physics Derivation Graph is similar to <a href="ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/qed/manifesto">the QED manifesto</a>.

  <P>Rather than struggle to fit everything into a formal rigorous basis, the implementation for the Physics Derivation Graph uses Latex to encode math. Some expressions are represented using SymPy, with the hope that the Latex and SymPy refer to the same concepts.

  <P>By focusing on specific and practical demonstrations, the Physics Derivation Graph will provide value to teachers, students, and researchers.

    <em>What lessons have you learned in implementing the Physics Derivation Graph?</em><BR/>
  </a>
My observations are specific to the nuances of the
project and my personality.
<UL>
  <LI>There's effort involved in balancing the constant questioning of "am
I doing this right?" with "what's the best way to do this?" and "which
problem should I be solving?" Because I wasn't told what to do or what
tactics to use, I have to have the stamina and confidence to persist
without encouragement or feedback.
  <LI>I'm not afraid to rewrite capabilities once I learn how to better
solve a problem. I've restructured the content through multiple
concepts. Discarding old code is a way of evolving.
  <LI>I am very hesitant to use the latest frameworks or languages if I
expect they won't last as long as the project is intended to. I favor
durability over convenience or agility.
  <LI>The sources of a refactoring have been because either I learn
something new in programming or I have a new insight on the problem.
Both of these are unpredictable, so I have to be willing to invest in
code development that is likely to be discarded.
  <LI>Keeping a log (https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/) has
been immensely valuable because I can monitor my progress and track
decisions. I can revisit my justifications to see whether they are
still valid.

Knowing what the requirements of the data structure up front would
have reduced the time wasted with insufficient data structures.
<P>
Better understanding where the Physics Derivation Graph fits with
respect to semantics and formal proofs would have helped with finding
relevant communities of practitioners.
The Physics Derivation Graph fits with neither semantics nor proof
assistants, but somewhere in between. I think I know how my work
relates to mathematical proofs; I'm not clear how my work relates to
semantic tagging and structures.

This is a way of uniquely identifying each component in the graph.

  Derivations used in Physics are mathematical expressions linked by a finite set of inference rules.

  In this graph, nodes are expressions and edges are inference rules.

  Expressions are typically placed in a topic within Physics. Conceptually, this would look like <BR/>

      <LI> Reading =/= understanding in math and physics. You understand a topic only if you can solve the problems.</LI>
      <LI> Work through the solved problems you encounter in textbooks carefully.</LI>
      <LI> Most people around me have never read any physics textbook cover to cover. E.g. reading Halliday, Resnick & Walker completely might take you years! Not all topics are equally important. Focus on the important parts.</LI>
      <LI> You need guidance on what is important and what is not. Online courses, college material (especially problem sets!), teaching webpages could be a helpful guide. MIT OCW is an excellent resource, once you are ready for it.</LI>
      <LI> Finding someone to talk to is really useful. You will likely have questions. Cultivating some relationship that allows you to ask questions is invaluable.</LI>
      <LI> College courses in math and physics have a very definitive order. It is really difficult to skip any step along the way. E.g. to understand special relativity, you must first understand classical physics and electrodynamics.</LI>
      <LI> Be prepared that the timescales in physics are long. Often, what turns people off is that they do not get things quickly (e.g. in 15-30 minutes). If you find yourself thinking hours about seemingly simple problems, do not despair! That is normal in physics.</LI>
      <LI> You have to 'soak in' physics. It takes time. Initially, you might feel like you do not make a lot of progress, but the more you know, the quicker it will get. Give yourself time and be patient and persistent.</LI>
      <LI> Often, just writing things down helps a lot with making things stick. It is a way of developing 'muscle memory'. So try and take notes while reading. Copying out solved problems from textbooks is also a good technique.</LI>
      <LI> Counterintuitive: If you get completely stuck, move on! Learning often happens in non-linear ways. If you hit an insurmountable roadblock, just keep going. When you return in a few days/weeks, things will almost certainly be clearer.</LI>

The goal (documenting all known Physics) sounds crackpot-ish. The approach doesn't disallow crackpot statements -- checking derivation steps using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">computer algebra system</a> doens't prevent physically nonsensical conclusions.<BR/>

<em>Can the Physics Derivation Graph be used to prove Physics?</em>
</a><BR/>
    No. "Proof" is not a well-defined term in Physics. <BR/>
    From a Stack Exchange <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/82493/how-important-is-mathematical-proof-in-physics">answer</a>,
<blockquote>
Mathematical proofs relate to exactly how a MODEL will behave. They don't have much to do with how the real world behaves. If the mathematics is carried out correctly, then one has "proven" how the model will behave.
</blockquote>

The reason for experimentation, is to find out if the completely fictional MODEL that somebody simply made up, behaves in any way the same, as observations suggest the real world behaves. If it doesn't, that is not an indication of a mathematical error, it simply means the fictional model is not a good description of the real world, and must be changed.

<em>Does this approach apply to other fields?</em>
</a><BR/>
There is not clear application of the concepts used in the Physics Derivation Graph to other fields (ie chemistry, linguistics, economics, mathematics, etc). <BR/>
The physics derivation graph can handle proving mathematical identities, ie Euler's equation, but that wasn't the intent. <BR/>
The difference between a derivation and proving an identity is that when proving an identity, only one side of the equation is manipulated. For a derivation, both sides of the expression are involved.
