Although the PDG can be done in a CAS (ie Mathematica), it won't translate to other CASes without having associated Godel indices.<br />
<br />
Symbols can be composed of other symbols. Example: $E$ and $\vec{E}$, $\partial$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$<br />
<br />
Symbols can be operators, ie $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$<br />
<br />
Operators, ie $+$, can act on symbols<br />
