<H1>comparison of Latex versus knowledge management efforts</H1>

<P><small>Published 2021-08-08T15:26:00.002Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

<p>In this post I assess why Latex is widely use and knowledge management efforts are not.&nbsp;<br />I'm using the spectrum documented in <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2021/08/spectrum-of-formalized-scientific.html">this previous post</a>.</p><p><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Latex for typesetting scientific documents</h3><p>Latex was free, open source, well designed, solved a specific problem that had been unaddressed, the problem was felt by the content creators, is comprehensive, written by a single author, and the author was famous.</p><p>Now Latex has a user community, developers, libraries of software, reference books, support on multiple operating systems as well as the web.</p><p>Anything seeking to augment or displace Latex will need a value differentiation that is felt by content creators.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Semantic enrichment</h3><ul>
<li> Start with Latex and manually annotate</li>
<li> Start with Latex; use manually annotated corpus to train supervised machine learning model</li>
  <li> Start with a custom domain specific language </li>
  </ul>
  
<p>Manual annotation or supervised machine learning may be incomplete if there are missing steps or assumptions.</p><p>"Better search" isn't a problem felt by content creators. This need is somewhat addressed by citations.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not aware of any models of success for semantic enrichment.</p><p><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Controlled Natural Languages</h3><div>Not widely adopted: Mizar, ForTheL, Physics Derivation Graph</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm not aware of any models of success for CNLs.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Formal Verification</h3><div>Lean, Coq, Isabelle,&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Burdensome to learn and to use.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><p></p><p></p>
