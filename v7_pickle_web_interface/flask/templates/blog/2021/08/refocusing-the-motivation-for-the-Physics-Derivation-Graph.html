<H1>refocusing the motivation for the Physics Derivation Graph</H1>

<P><small>Published 2021-08-21T00:58:00.003Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

<p>The following aspects are "nice-to-have" in the <a href="https://derivationmap.net/">Physics Derivation Graph</a>:</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>validation of derivation steps using computer algebra systems</li><li>validation of consistency&nbsp;expression dimensions</li><li>validation of consistency of units when present in expressions</li><li>visualization of the graph</li><li>make the code pretty and easy to navigate for contributors</li><li>document the source code and design decisions</li><li>searching the graph (see <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2021/08/searching-physics-derivation-graph.html">this</a> and <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2020/05/why-web-interfaces-are-limited-in.html">this</a> and <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2020/07/searching-math-and-physics-content.html">this</a>)</li><li>ability to determine whether paper is written by a crackpot</li><li>ability to detect unintentional errors in an article or book</li><li>cross-document references</li><li>semantic tagging of Latex documents</li><li>converting Latex from <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arxiv</a> into formats supporting the above objectives</li><li>linking <a href="https://derivationmap.net/">Physics Derivation Graph</a> to existing ontology databases</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>The core objective of the Physics Derivation Graph is identifying the mathematical connectivity of the various domains of Physics. The same connectivity should be able to relate "basic" Physics (e.g., <i>F=ma</i>) to advanced Physics (e.g., the theory of the Standard model, string theory).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I know of two ways to document the connectivity:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>identify symbol re-use</li><li>identify inter-related derivations at the level of expressions</li></ul><div>The symbol re-use is less interesting than the re-use of expressions.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I've previously documented a plan,</div><div><a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2017/07/finding-edges-for-physics-derivation.html">https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2017/07/finding-edges-for-physics-derivation.html</a></div><div>but I didn't specify what would qualify as sufficient to show completeness.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>What core expressions are representative of all of Physics? Are there a set of expressions that, if shown to be connected by derivations, would be sufficient to demonstrate the span of the concept?</div><div><br /></div><div>I expect that, for any given subdomain of Physics, there are central expressions. The task list is then</div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>identify every named expression in Physics</li><li>identify every variable in that list of named expressions</li><li>enter all named expressions and variables into the PDG database</li><li>determine which expressions are not connected to anything</li></ol></div><p></p>
