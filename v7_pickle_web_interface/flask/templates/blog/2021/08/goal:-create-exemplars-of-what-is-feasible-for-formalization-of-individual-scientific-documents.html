<H1>goal: create exemplars of what is feasible for formalization of individual scientific documents</H1>

<p>There's a lot of knowledge management decorations available for a single document: hyperlinks, semantic tagging, ontologies, controlled natural languages, CAS validation, theorem provers. What would it take to put them all together in one Physics article?&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of this post is to provide an example of what that process is like for a document.
