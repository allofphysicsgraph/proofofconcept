<H1>acceptance criteria for a new inference rule</H1>

<P><small>Published 2021-08-14T11:12:00.006Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

<p>What are my acceptance criteria for a new inference rule? How do I know when something is atomic versus when it can be broken into existing inference rules?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Does inversion matter? The following are redundant:</p><p>"add X to both sides of expression" is interchangeable with "subtract Z from both sides of expression"</p><p>and&nbsp;</p><p>"multiple both sides of expression by X" is interchangeable with "divide both sides of expression by Z"</p>
