<H1>Steps to convert a published scientific paper into the Physics Derivation Graph</H1>

<P><small>Published 2021-08-08T15:15:00.002Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

<p>This post documents the steps taken to get the derivations in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04818.pdf">Speed of sound from fundamental physical constants</a>&nbsp;into the Physics Derivation Graph.&nbsp;</p><p>1) Read the paper. I need to understand the point of the paper and where content is in the text.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>2) Identify the primary result of the derivation. Which equation is the output? Is there more than one?
In this paper, equation 1 is the primary result. 

</p><p><i>Tangent</i>: I tested the question of whether the most popular equation is the most important. <br />
This is measurable using the command
</p><pre>cat sound1.tex | tr " " "\n" |\          # replace spaces with newlines -- word tokenization
   grep "ref{" |\                        # find internal references to labeled expressions
   sed 's/.*\\ref{//' | sed 's/}.*//' |\ # remove the irrelevant latex "\ref{}" to isolate the expression label ID
   sort | uniq -c | sort -n              # rank the popularity of expression labels
2 v001
3 abinitio
3 all
3 ratio
3 v0
3 v01
3 v1
5 elemental
6 bohr
6 rydberg
11 a
15 v00
15 v3
</pre>

Decoding those latex labels to equations in the PDF,
"v3" is equation 9, which is tied for most popular with "v00" -- equation 4. The second most popular label "a" is equation 10.
The equation I'm claiming as the primary result, equation 1, is labeled as "v0" and is referenced 3 times.

<p><br /></p><p>3) What sections of the paper contain the derivation?<br />
There are actually two derivations of the same result.
  </p><ul>
<li> one derivation is on page 2 column 1</li>
  <li> another derivation is on page 2 column 2</li>
  </ul>

  <p><br /></p><p>
4) On paper, write out equations from the paper. Here I'm limiting the scope to one derivation on page 2 column 1. Fill in additional equations that are missing from the text. Use arrows to denote flow of derivation.

</p><p>Often I'll make math mistakes or go down paths that turn out to be irrelevant. If I were a typical researcher, this is where the reconstruction process would stop.</p><p><br /></p><p>5) On a separate paper, rewrite the graph and label the edges in the directed graph to describe the operation being carried out.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>6) On a separate paper, rewrite the content from the previous step to refine the "operation being carried out" to a directed graph with inference rules available in the Physics Derivation Graph.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>7) Enter the symbols used in this derivation in&nbsp;<a href="https://derivationmap.net/list_all_symbols#add%20symbol">https://derivationmap.net/list_all_symbols#add%20symbol</a> or identify pre-existing symbols and record their PDG ID.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>8) If novel inference rules are needed for this derivation, enter those in&nbsp;<a href="https://derivationmap.net/list_all_inference_rules#add_inf_rule">https://derivationmap.net/list_all_inference_rules#add_inf_rule</a></p><p><br /></p><p>9) Using&nbsp;<a href="https://derivationmap.net/start_new_derivation/">https://derivationmap.net/start_new_derivation/</a>, enter the expressions and inference rules for the steps of the derivation. For each step,&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>ensure the symbols are referenced correctly in each expression</li><li>ensure the SymPy version of the expression is correct</li></ul><p></p><p>The output of this step is&nbsp;<a href="https://derivationmap.net/review_derivation/608598/">https://derivationmap.net/review_derivation/608598/</a></p><p><br /></p><p>10) Offline, in the JSON file containing the derivation, edit the symbol IDs and SymPy representations as needed to get the step validations to be correct.&nbsp;</p><p>Review the modifications on&nbsp;<a href="https://derivationmap.net/review_derivation/608598/">https://derivationmap.net/review_derivation/608598/</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><i>TODO</i>: The extensive linking of variables to definitions is not made accessible in the output, so there is no way for the user to leverage the linked information.&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>expressions in the PDF/HTML output contain variables which have no link to their definitions</li><li>variables in the text of the PDF/HTML output are not linked to the expressions or their definitions</li></ul><div>As a result of the above observation,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/allofphysicsgraph/proofofconcept/issues/217">https://github.com/allofphysicsgraph/proofofconcept/issues/217</a> was opened.&nbsp;</div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
