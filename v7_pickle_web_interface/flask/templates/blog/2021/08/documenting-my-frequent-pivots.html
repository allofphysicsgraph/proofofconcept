<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <LI>survey all of Physics. [See <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2017/07/finding-edges-for-physics-derivation.html">this 2017-07 post</a>.]
  <li>investigate refactoring the database from JSON to RDF. [See <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2020/12/identifying-classes-in-physics.html">this 2020-12 post</a>.]</li>
  <li><i>goal</i>: add a new derivation to the <a href="https://derivationmap.net/">Physics Derivation Graph</a> to identify bugs and inefficiencies in the workflow</li>
  <li>instead of entering a new derivation, new goal is to create tutorials for an existing derivation. [See <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2021/08/steps-to-convert-published-scientific.html">this 2021-08 post</a>.]</li>
  <li>before creating tutorials, write a "gold standard" for one derivation (then create tutorials). [See <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2021/07/roadmap-for-identifying-mathematical.html">this 2021-07 post</a>.]</li>
  <li>instead of fixating on a "gold standard," refocus on the original intent of the project: connecting expressions from the breadth of Physics. [See <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2021/08/refocusing-motivation-for-physics.html">this 2021-08 post</a>.]</li>
</ul>
