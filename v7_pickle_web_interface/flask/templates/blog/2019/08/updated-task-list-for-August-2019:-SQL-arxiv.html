<H1>updated task list for August 2019: SQL, arxiv</H1>

<P><small>Published 2019-08-09T15:01:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Since posting <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2019/05/task-list.html">my previous task list</a> in May I made good progress with Docker and a Flask-based web interface. The Flask web interface progressed far enough that I need to connect the front end with the SQL database backend. Listing out next steps,<br />
<ul>
<li>The SQL database needs to be connected to the Flask-based web frontend</li>
<li>The SQL database needs to be populated with content from the CSVs (expressions and inference rules and derivations in version 6)</li>
</ul>

A colleague found that Latex source for arxiv articles is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data_s3">in bulk in S3 buckets</a>. As an alternative to S3 arxiv points to a subset that's available without going through AWS: <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/kddcup/datasets.html">https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/kddcup/datasets.html</a></div>
<div>
The value of having a large number of expressions in Latex is that we could use the expressions to predict what a user wants to enter, decreasing the amount of manual entry required. Also, if a derivation contains similar expressions to what exists in the arxiv content, we could investigate whether the derivation is related to the arxiv paper.</div>
