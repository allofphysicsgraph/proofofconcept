<H1>visualize success and then deliver the minimum viable product</H1>

<P><small>Published 2016-05-28T01:19:00.002Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Today I applied two principles and made tremendous progress. First, I thought about what success meant for the Physics Derivation Graph. The central claim is that mathematical physics can be represented as a single graph. My insight was that I should simply focus on that. The second principle was determining the&nbsp;minimum viable product to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;that vision of success.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The outcome is a hyperlinked SVG of concepts and topics:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://allofphysicsgraph.github.io/proofofconcept/site/sandbox/topic_and_concept_graph.svg">http://allofphysicsgraph.github.io/proofofconcept/site/sandbox/topic_and_concept_graph.svg</a><br />
<br />
This is a map of topics (ie Quantum Mechanics) and concepts (ie Schrodinger's Equation) in Physics.<br />
<br />
I've drawn edges between concepts where there exists a paper detailing the mathematical connection<br />
<br />
In the SVG, edges which are bold can be clicked to see the referenced URL<br />
<br />
<br />
There's an equivalent PNG, but the hyperlinks aren't active:<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The point of this graph is that<br />
<ol>
<li>the major topics in Physics are present</li>
<li>the major topics are linked to associated concepts</li>
<li>there are mathematical links between the concepts</li>
</ol>
The remaining work is to
<br />
4) fill in with additional concepts so that there is a path from any blue box (topic) to any other blue box through only red ellipses (concepts). Then the claim will be validated in theory.&nbsp;
<br />
5) After that, go back and fill in the actual math using expressions and inference rules.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
6) Verify correctness of steps using a CAS<br />
<ul>
<li>break Latex expressions into constituent symbols and operators (<a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/files/mathSurvey.pdf">ref 1</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.198.8849&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">ref 2</a>, <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/4223/what-parsers-for-latex-mathematics-exist-outside-of-the-tex-engines">ref 3</a>)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<i>Then I'm done!</i>
<br />
<br />
<br />
The PDG isn't "complete" in accounting for all of Physics, but I didn't expect to go that far. Showing complete coverage of topics is sufficient.
