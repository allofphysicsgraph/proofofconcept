<H1>graph visualization isn't a requirement for the Physics Derivation Graph</H1>

<P><small>Published 2016-09-01T13:37:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

The central concept of the Physics Derivation Graph is that there are mathematical links between expressions. This means that navigating the content can be intuitively done using a graph. However, navigating a graph visually doesn't scale well.<br />
<br />
The Physics Derivation Graph doesn't have to be presented as a graph. A derivation is typically presented in a linear format.<br />
<br />
Storing the content of the Physics Derivation Graph does not require a graph storage database.
