<H1>the role of a lexer and parser</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-06-07T02:12:00.001Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

A lexer detects patterns in a sequence of characters (the input string). The patterns are specified as regex in a grammar file (e.g., ANTLR's .g4 file).<br />
<br />
The lexer produces a stream of tokens consumed by the parser.<br />
<br />
A parser assembles an AST<br />
The nodes of the AST are tokens.<br />
The parser then has a set of rules which are used to apply actions.<br />
For example (in the context of the Physics Derivation Graph), the rules produce Sympy expressions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For the Physics Derivation Graph, the lexer will be consuming math latex.<br />
<br />
The math latex strings are expected to be agnostic to which Physics domain the .tex file is from.<br />
In contrast, the parser rules may be domain-specific.
