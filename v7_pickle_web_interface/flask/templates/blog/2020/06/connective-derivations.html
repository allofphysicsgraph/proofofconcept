<H1>connective derivations</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-06-28T13:16:00.004Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

There are multiple derivations associated with waveguides. However, I don't see derivations focused on waveguides as being connective to any other topic. <br />
<br />
Similarly the Navier-Stokes equation for fluids doesn't seem to relate any topics (though I have less experience with this compared to waveguides).<br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>There is probably a "connective derivation" that relates Quantum Mechanics to Statistical mechanics, probably involving the definition of entropy.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Another connection is that Statistical mechanics is related to thermodynamics (again, not clear what derivation would show this).&nbsp;</li>
<li>classical mechanics and astrophysics are based on the same concepts</li>
<li>There should be a relation between (classical motion) and (relativity) since the difference is the assumptions about slow versus fast objects.</li>
<li>Wave-particle duality present in optics relates to atomic theory</li>
<li>the orbit of Mercury relates astrophysics to relativity</li>
<li>thermodynamics connects to quantum mechanics in the&nbsp;black-body radiation experiment</li>
<li>quantum field theory relates relativity to quantum</li>
</ul>

I don't have insight on how electrodynamics relates to quantum mechanics or how electrodynamics relates to classical mechanics.&nbsp;</div>
