<H1>proposal for analysis of math used in a subdomain of Physics based on the arXiv corpus</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-05-31T12:50:00.002Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

What type of math is used in the High-Energy Physics (HEP) corpus available from arXiv?<br />
Example categories include<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>geometry</li>
<li>trigonometry</li>
<li>integration</li>
<li>differential equations</li>
<li>sets</li>
<li>linear algebra</li>
</ul>
<div>
Motives for asking this question:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>if I read a randomly selected paper in HEP, what math should I have fluency in?</li>
<li>are there papers in HEP that use math which is unusual compared to the majority? For example, is there only one paper that uses geometry?</li>
<li>what is the diversity of math per author? (For multi-author papers, tag each author with all the math categories.)</li>
<li>what is the diversity of math per paper? (How many types of math appear in a given paper?)</li>
</ul>
</div>
