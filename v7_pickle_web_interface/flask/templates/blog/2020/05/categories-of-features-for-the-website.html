<H1>categories of features for the website</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-05-02T15:39:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Although the Physics Derivation Graph is currently available as a website (<a href="http://derivationmap.net/">http://derivationmap.net/</a>) I am unwilling to share the URL with other people. The lack of features means they could get the wrong impression.<br />
<br />
There are lots of missing features which result in an inadequate site. The categories of missing features are<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>essential functionality. Examples:&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>entering symbols</li>
<li>entering units and dimensions for variables</li>
<li>unit checking</li>
<li>dimensional analysis</li>
<li>search</li>
</ul>
<li>ease of workflow. Examples:&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>display latex expression along with ID in dropdown</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/allofphysicsgraph/proofofconcept/issues/145">static sitemap</a></li>
</ul>
<li>professionalism. Examples:</li>
<ul>
<li>Google Sign In</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div>
There are additional features that are not vital to showing other users. For example, the "monitoring" page and tracing user behavior.</div>
