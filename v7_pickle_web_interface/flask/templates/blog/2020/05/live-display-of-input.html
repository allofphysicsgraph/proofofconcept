<H1>live display of input</H1>

I realized it would be helpful to provide users a live preview of what the Latex renders as so the mistaken input can be corrected before submitting a step. (Decreasing feedback latency is a recurring theme.)<br />
<br />
There are Javascript-based approaches like<br />

(see demo here -&nbsp;<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/mYjrn/1/">https://jsfiddle.net/mYjrn/1/</a>&nbsp;)<br />
and<br />
<a href="https://demos.joypixels.com/latest/live-preview.html">https://demos.joypixels.com/latest/live-preview.html</a><br />
but these both rely on JQuery.<br />
<br />
JQuery is "a tool used to make writing common JavaScript tasks more concise." (source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-jquery">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-jquery</a>&nbsp;)<br />
I want to avoid unnecessary dependencies, so live preview of text that relies on JQuery is unattractive.<br />
<br />
I was able to find a live preview example that is written in pure Javascript:<br />
<a href="https://www.codespeedy.com/show-live-preview-of-html-textarea-with-javascript/">https://www.codespeedy.com/show-live-preview-of-html-textarea-with-javascript/</a><br />
I can get that to work on my website, but wrapping the output in \( \) to get Mathjax to interpret the live input does not work.<br />
<br />
I needed to find a "live preview of Mathjax" since the input is parsed as Latex.<br />
This snippet from 2013 didn't work<br />
<a href="https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax-docs/wiki/More-live-preview-examples">https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax-docs/wiki/More-live-preview-examples</a><br />
but a similar code posted here<br />
<a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/mathjax/MathJax/2.7.1/test/sample-dynamic.html">https://cdn.rawgit.com/mathjax/MathJax/2.7.1/test/sample-dynamic.html</a><br />
does work for live preview of Mathjax!<br />
<br />
That link is for 2.7 but I had been using Mathjax 3. I couldn't find a v3-based approach, so I posted a question<br />
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61658297/mathjax-live-preview-for-version-3">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61658297/mathjax-live-preview-for-version-3</a><br />
and was directed to<br />
<a href="https://mathjax.github.io/MathJax-demos-web/input-tex2chtml.html">https://mathjax.github.io/MathJax-demos-web/input-tex2chtml.html</a><br />
which is a suitable solution for v3.
