<H1>latex is for rendering presentation and does not provide semantics</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-05-20T20:08:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Latex is used in the Physics Derivation Graph to specify mathematical expressions. This is a poor choice in that Latex does not provide explicit semantics for the content. That association is typically left to the human reader.<br />
<br />
In the Physics Derivation Graph we could manually assign semantic meaning to each expression. That's a tedious task.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, we could<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>parse the arxiv database and find the most common expressions</li>
<li>assign semantic meaning to those.&nbsp;</li>
<li>when the expression arises in the Physics Derivation Graph, the most likely interpretation of that expression is what has previously been labeled.</li>
</ol>
