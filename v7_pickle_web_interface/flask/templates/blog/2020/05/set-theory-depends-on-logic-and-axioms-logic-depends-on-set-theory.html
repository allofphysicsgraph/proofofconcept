<H1>set theory depends on logic and axioms; logic depends on set theory</H1>

The inference rules used in the Physics Derivation Graph could probably be reduced to a more fundamental basis.<br /><br />The problem is that set theory starts by assuming logical rules and axioms, while the rules of logic are based on set theory.<br />
<br />
From the perspective of a Physicist, the only relevance is that the rules being used are self-consistent.
