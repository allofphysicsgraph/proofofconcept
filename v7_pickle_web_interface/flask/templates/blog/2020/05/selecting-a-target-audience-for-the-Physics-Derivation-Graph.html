<H1>selecting a target audience for the Physics Derivation Graph</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-05-13T18:10:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

I've recognized the Physics Derivation Graph has a few potential audiences: teachers, students, researchers, publishing.<br />
<br />
Of these, targeting students makes the most sense:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>the math is easier</li>
<li>less legacy momentum (e.g., "this is how we've done it before")</li>
<li>educators value free (rather than paid subscription)</li>
</ul>
