<H1>prioritizing work for the Physics Derivation Graph</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-05-21T11:48:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Now that the website works, there are three candidate categories of work:<br />
<div dir="auto">
<ul>
<li>Presentation -- how does the site look, e.g., tables, use of color. images,</li>
<li>Functionality -- what features exist, e.g. step validation, manipulating the graphs, form entry</li>
<li>Content -- what derivations, symbols, expressions are present</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div dir="auto">
Of these three, content is most important with functionality being second. Functionality enables the workflow.</div>
<div dir="auto">
<br /></div>
<div dir="auto">
Within the category of "content," there are three sub-categories:</div>
<div dir="auto">
<ul>
<li>Derivations</li>
<li>Abstract syntax trees -- how symbols and operators relate within an expression</li>
<li>Inference rules</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div dir="auto">
Of those three, the derivations are the highest priority. Inference rules enable derivations.&nbsp;</div>
<br />
<div dir="auto">
</div>
<br />
<div dir="auto">
The parsing of expressions in support of step validation is nice to have but not vital.</div>
<div dir="auto">
<br /></div>
<div dir="auto">
Within the topic of derivations, there is a plethora of candidates to invest in. Priorities are</div>
<div dir="auto">
<ul>
<li>subject scope diversity -- span all topics in Physics</li>
<li>simplicity -- not too many steps, easy math</li>
<li>interconnectedness with other topics</li>
</ul>
<div>
<br /></div>
</div>
