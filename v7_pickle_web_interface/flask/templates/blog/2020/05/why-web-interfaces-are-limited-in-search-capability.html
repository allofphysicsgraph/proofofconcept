<H1>why web interfaces are limited in search capability</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-05-20T19:46:00.004Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Webpages have content. For text content, a common task is to search for something.<br />
Web browsers have a plain text search feature, usually mapped to ctrl+f.<br />
<br />
<b>Why don't websites feature richer search functionality?&nbsp;</b><br />
For example, sorting tables, regular expressions for text, SQL, Cypher/Gremlin, infinite scroll (rather than pagination).<br />
<br />
Answers include<br />
<ul>
<li>adding complex functionality takes effort</li>
<li>most users will be confused by advanced search capability</li>
<li>complex search features can be used maliciously/incorrectly if direct access to the backend database is allowed:&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>a user could delete data via SQL</li>
<li>a user could edit data</li>
</ul>
<li>if a user is given read-only access to the server, a user could write an infinite loop and saturate server resources</li>
</ul>
<div>
Shipping all the data to the front-end isn't reasonable when the data is large (e.g., more than 1 MB), so interaction with the back-end is necessary (e.g., for pagination).</div>
