<H1>avoiding the need for logins in the Physics Derivation Graph website</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-03-14T01:19:00.002Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Now that the PDG interface is a webpage, and users (not just developers) are the audience, there is a question of whether users of the website need accounts.<br />
<br />
<h3>
User accounts</h3>
Having an account would enable persistence of data specific to one user.<br />
Downsides:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Password management and security</li>
<li>user account shenanigans</li>
<li><br /></li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>
No users accounts</h3>
Live use without an account, modeled after services like&nbsp;<a href="https://repl.it/">https://repl.it/</a>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onlinecharttool.com/graph">https://www.onlinecharttool.com/graph</a>, enable users to explore the capabilities without need for registering and creating a password.<br />
<br />
Data could be uploaded and download<br />
<h3>
Source code</h3>
<div>
Historically the Physics Derivation Graph was developed on the command line using bash and Python. This implied a single user.<br />
The source code was available, so other developers could pull a local copy to make edits.<br />
<br /></div>
<h3>
API calls</h3>
<div>
This would allow interfaces to be developed that are independent of the backend.</div>
