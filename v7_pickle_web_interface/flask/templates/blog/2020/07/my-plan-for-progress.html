<H1>my plan for progress</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-07-29T01:25:00.002Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Although my previous post on <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2020/07/barriers-to-implementing-formalization.html">barriers to formalization of mathematics</a> is pessimistic, the observations are reassuring to me. I'm not duplicating the work of others, and my evaluation of options are reasonable. Few others seem interested in the problems I care about, which means I'm not missing important collaborations.<br />
<br />
My approach of relying on Latex and focusing on Physics is not typical of this community.<br />
I'm not targeting use by researchers since they want (minimal disruption to existing workflow) and (full formalization and rigor).<br />
I'm not targeting use by students who seek support for homework problem solving and numerical computation.<br />
I don't expect integration with any existing projects.<br />
<br />
