<h3>
Survey of languages for formalizing math :: Cezary Kaliszyk</h3>
<br />
<i>Observation</i>: The language of formal systems is not the way mathematicians actually communicate (in person verbally, in writing).<br />
Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) and Proof Assistants are viewed as "code" separate from Natural Language.<br />
<br />
Natural Language Processing (NLP) of math does not recognize repeated use of the same notation, whereas humans recognize that as a convention.<br />
<br />
Aspects that distinguish formal from informal communication: types, inheritance, equality (isomorphism). Each of those aspects are typically implicit for human consumers.<br />
The goal of formal specification is proof, whereas in informal communication the goal is to convince the reader. Those are distinct.<br />
<br />
Spectrum of math language formality:<br />

&lt;-- more informal&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;more formal --&gt;<br />
<br />
<i>Observation</i>: formal language can be more concise than Controlled Natural Language due to possibility of autocompletion in formal languages.

<br />
<br />
Cezary expects deep learning to be useful in translation from informal to formal languages, though the capability seems to vary.<br />
<br />
<h3>
Representing Structural Language features in formal meta languages :: Dennis Muller</h3>
<br />
MMT is defined in a 2013 Kohlhase paper "A scalable module system"<br />
MMT is for math theories.<br />
<br />
<h3>
Formalization of Elementary Number Theory in Mizar :: Adam Naumowicz</h3>
Mizar has 60,000 theorems and 12,000 definitions in 1300 files.<br />
Mizar is based on set theory.<br />
<br />
The focus of this talk is the first 10 problems from the 1970 textbook by&nbsp;Sierpinski.<br />
<br />
<i>Question from audience</i>: when will Mizar be open source?<br />Adam has no problem with open sourcing Mizar.<br />The specific barrier is not clear to me.<br />
<br />
<h3>
Interpreting Math texts in Naproche-SAD :: Peter Koepke</h3>
Naproche = Natural Proof Checking<br />
SAD = System of Automated Deduction<br />
<br />
The origin of Mizar is in a 1985 paper "Computer Aided Reasoning" by Blair and Trybulec<br />
<br />
<h3>
Integrating ForTheL with Latex :: Adrian De Lon</h3>
technique is to separate Latex text from math Latex and then develop separate grammars.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/adelon/nave">https://github.com/adelon/nave</a>&nbsp;- written in Haskell<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>
Guided tour of Formally verified constraint solvers :: Catherine Dubois</h3>
bugs have been found in constraint programming<br />
<br />
