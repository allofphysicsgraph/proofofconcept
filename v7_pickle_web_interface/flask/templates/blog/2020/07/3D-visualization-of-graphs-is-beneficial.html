<H1>3D visualization of graphs is beneficial</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-07-28T16:42:00.003Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Currently the Physics Derivation Graph has 2D graphs.<br />
<br />
3D visualization of graphs is useful:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>3D is important for larger graphs because of the extra spacing enabled compared to 2D</li>
<li>visualization helps identify mistakes in the data structure</li>
<li>statically placed 3D graphs are useful and can be navigate in the browser (VR is unnecessary)</li>
<li>interactive rotation of perspective matters to making spacing of nodes visually accessible for human pattern detection</li>
<li>coloring, weights, filtering edges, filtering nodes, and filtering types makes the viz less noisy</li>
</ul>
