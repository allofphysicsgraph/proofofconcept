<H1>where to invest my efforts; prioritization depends on objective</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-08-07T16:15:00.001Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Options on where to spend my attention on this project include<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>semantic decoration of text</li>
<li>trying to figure out how semantic decoration connects to the underlying inference rules</li>
<li>generating PDG Latex content using existing infrastructure</li>
<li>verifying existing PDG content by converting to SymPy</li>
<li>expanding the SymPy Latex grammar for better parsing and conversion</li>
<li>improving the front-end presentation</li>
<li>improving the data input interface</li>
<li>changing the backend database from JSON + SQL to something cleaner</li>
</ul>
<div>
I'm not completely clear on what my motives for the PDG are.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I find the work interesting</li>
<li>I think other people might also be interested</li>
<li>I'm not clear what specific value the project provides (other than attempting to document the beauty of the math and Physics)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
I'm not sure whether I'm doing this for myself, for my legacy, or for other people.<br />
<br />
My own lack of clarity translates into not being certain about where to invest my attention.<br />
Options like more content, more integration with other aspects, better code all pull in different directions.<br />
I think that if I better understood my own intentions I would have the ability to more easily prioritize.</div>
