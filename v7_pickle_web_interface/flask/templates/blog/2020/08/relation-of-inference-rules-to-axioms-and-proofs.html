<H1>relation of inference rules to axioms and proofs</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-08-27T22:01:00.003Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Axioms are a set of statements upon which other statements can be formed.<br />
<br />
Lemmas are easy but irrelevant.<br />
Corollaries are quick but irrelevant consequences<br />
Propositions are interesting<br />
Theorems are important and difficult<br />

<br />
A proof is about consistency of statements with respect to a set of axioms.<br />

To show the connection can be made, pick the simplest PDG inference rules.<br />
* "add X to both sides"<br />
* "multiply both sides by"
