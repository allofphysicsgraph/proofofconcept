<H1>linear representation of a directed graph</H1>

A derivation typically does not show all steps. The steps of a derivation are typically not linear.  <br />

Figure 1: left side is a directed acyclic graph where some nodes are hidden and each node can be linearly ordered. In the center all nodes have been shown in a linear presentation. On the right, all nodes in a non-linear display.
