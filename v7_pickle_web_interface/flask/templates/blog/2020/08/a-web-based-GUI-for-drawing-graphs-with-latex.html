<H1>a web-based GUI for drawing graphs with latex</H1>

Back in 2014 the EquationMap interface featured the ability enter latex into nodes and create graphs with edges.<br />

Similar web interfaces for drawing graphs include<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/neyric/wireit">https://github.com/neyric/wireit</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/neyric/webhookit">https://github.com/neyric/webhookit</a>&nbsp;(both no longer supported)</li>
<li>Cytoscape.js; see&nbsp;<a href="https://pathwaycommons.github.io/cytoscape-sbgn-stylesheet/">https://pathwaycommons.github.io/cytoscape-sbgn-stylesheet/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://modeling-languages.com/javascript-drawing-libraries-diagrams/">https://modeling-languages.com/javascript-drawing-libraries-diagrams/</a></li>
</ul>

However, none of these support rendering Latex or Mathjax</div>

My current approach of generating PNG images from Latex and then rendering the PNGs as a graph using d3.js seems to work sufficiently well. I could modify the interface such that the existing webform is on the same page as the rendered graph.</div>

The user would select an inference rule, provide the expressions, and render the graph all in a single page.<br />What isn't clear in my mental model is how to connect edges to new steps.&nbsp;</div>
