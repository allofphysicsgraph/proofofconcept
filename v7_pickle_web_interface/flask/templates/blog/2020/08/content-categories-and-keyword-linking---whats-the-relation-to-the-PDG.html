<H1>content categories and keyword linking - what's the relation to the PDG?</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-08-09T20:43:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

Suppose an article on ArXiv had full markup with <a href="https://github.com/OMdoc/OMDoc/wiki/PhysML">PhysML</a> and <a href="http://sciencewise.info/">ScienceWise</a>. While useful in aggregate for search, it's not clear how those would relate to the Physics Derivation Graph.<br />
<br />
The ScienceWise concept of linking keywords to a database would need to be expanded to linking variables to a database. Then one paper using "x" for position and another paper using "d" for position could link to the same variable definition (independent of symbol used).
