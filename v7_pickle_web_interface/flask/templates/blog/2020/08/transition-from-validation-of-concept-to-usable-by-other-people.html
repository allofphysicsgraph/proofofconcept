<H1>transition from "validation of concept" to "usable by other people"</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-08-16T14:12:00.001Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

My initial intent with the Physics Derivation Graph was to validate the concept of using a graph as a data structure for mathematical Physics. Creating the <a href="http://derivationmap.net">derivationmap.net</a> website was an important milestone -- I was proud of the content and the presentation. The previous website (<a href="https://allofphysicsgraph.github.io/proofofconcept/">https://allofphysicsgraph.github.io/proofofconcept/</a>) felt like merely a step beyond having a public code repo since the content was limited to displaying graphs.<br />
<br />
Now I can direct people to the <a href="http://derivationmap.net">derivationmap.net</a> website and not feel embarrassed by the limitations imposed by the host. The limitations of derivationmap.net are due to my creativity and technical skill.<br />
<br />
The consequence of feedback from interested people has been increased awareness of the roughness of the code. The code (HTML, Python, JSON) is not something I would find accessible if I were reviewing the project.<br />
<br />
Actions I can take to improve the accessibility of the code:<br />
<ul>
<li>better docstrings</li>
<li>use doctests</li>
<li>document the workflow</li>
</ul>
