<H1>milestones on the path to a live website</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-04-18T21:36:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

For the past few weeks I've always has "just a few more things" prior to me making the Physics Derivation Graph website live. As I progress, I keep adding more tasks that are necessary. This post is an effort to at least measure the scope creep.<br />
<br />
For me to feel comfortable with making the website live, the ordered list of tasks is<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>input multiple novel derivations to ensure the workflow is sensical, bug-free, and efficient</li>
<li>aggregate logs from Nginx, gunicorn, flask</li>
<li>implement sign-in capability</li>
<li>perform security checks and web form fuzzing</li>
<li>buy a domain</li>
<li>sign in with Google</li>
</ol>
<div>
I don't have a timeline for these milestones.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Update</i> <b>20200512</b>: all these steps are completed</div>
