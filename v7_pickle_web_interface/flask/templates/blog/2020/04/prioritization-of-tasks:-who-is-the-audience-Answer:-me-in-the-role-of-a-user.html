<H1>prioritization of tasks: who is the audience? Answer: me in the role of a user</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-04-30T14:44:00.001Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

The Physics Derivation Graph has a backlog of tasks, including bugs and feature requests.<br />
Having an objective would facilitate prioritization of the tasks.<br />
<br />
I grappled with two candidate objectives:<br />
<ul>
<li>The Physics Derivation Graph is a vanity project. I am the sole user and I don't expect any other users for the project</li>
<li>The Physics Derivation Graph is intended for use by other contributors.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>
These two objectives lead to different prioritizations. For example, resolving the login capability is vital for the second objective and not for the first. In the first objective, I would be better off just running a local Docker image and posting static content to the website.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I realized I could unify these two objectives as</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I want to use the Physics Derivation Graph website as a "typical" user.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>
I don't care whether there are other users at this point, but I do want to use the website as though I were a user.<br />
<br />
This objective is written as a story in which value is provided to the user. Here I am the user and the value is documenting derivations on the web.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
