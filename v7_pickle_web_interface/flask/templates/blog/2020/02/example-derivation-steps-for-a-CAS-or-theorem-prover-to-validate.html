<H1>example derivation steps for a CAS or theorem prover to validate</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-02-04T02:23:00.004Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

in order of increasing complexity, here are a set of&nbsp;derivation steps for a CAS or theorem prover to validate<br />
<br />
start with "a = b"<br />
add "2" to both sides<br />
end with "a + 2 = b + 2"<br />
<br />
<br />
start with "\sin x = f(x)"<br />
multiply both sides by "2"<br />
end with "2 \sin x = 2 f(x)"<br />
<br />
<br />
start with "\sin x = f(x)"<br />
substitute "2 y" for "x"<br />
end with "\sin (2 y) = f(2 y)"
