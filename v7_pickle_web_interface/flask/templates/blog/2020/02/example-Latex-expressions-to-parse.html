<h3>
valid ambiguous latex in a step in which the ambiguity can be resolved</h3>
input expression: \sin x / y = g<br />
inf rule: multiply both sides by y<br />
output expression: \sin x = g y<br />
<br />
Here the input expression is ambiguous -- it isn't clear whether "\sin x / y" = (\sin x)/y&nbsp; OR \sin (x/y)<br />
The output expression implies that (\sin x)/y was the user's intention.<br />
<br />
<br />
input expression: \sin x + 2 = g<br />
inf rule: subtract "2" from both sides<br />
output expression: \sin x = g - 2<br />
<br />
Here the input expression is ambiguous -- it isn't clear whether "\sin x + 2" = (\sin x) + 2&nbsp; OR \sin (x + 2)<br />
The output expression implies that (\sin x) + 2 was the user's intention.<br />
