<ul>
<li>parsing Latex expressions, e.g., \vec{x} and \hat{a}. The SymPy support exists, but the conversion of Latex to SymPy is not</li>
<li>novel operators, e.g., {\cal H}, how specify these operators in SymPy? - https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2020/09/latex-symbols-that-are-operators-how-to.html</li>
<li>Laplace operator \nabla^2, how to distinguish "\nabla^2" from "delop.dot(delop)" --&nbsp;https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2020/09/representing-laplace-operator-nabla-in.html</li>
<li>multi-line SymPy operations, like the need for "delop = Del()"</li>
<li>notation for definite integrals. This could be a structural issue with the Physics Derivation Graph, though it could be resolved with SymPy support (unlikely)&nbsp;-- https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2020/09/evaluating-definite-integrals-for.html</li>
