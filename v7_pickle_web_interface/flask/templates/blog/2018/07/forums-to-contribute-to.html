<H1>forums to contribute to</H1>

<P><small>Published 2018-07-20T01:27:00.002Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

I don't expect people to&nbsp;serendipitous stumble upon either this blog or <a href="https://github.com/allofphysicsgraph/proofofconcept">the github page</a> or <a href="http://allofphysicsgraph.github.io/proofofconcept/">the project page</a>. Therefore, part of my responsibility is to socialize the existence of my effort on forums that I think interested parties may already be a part of. Building a community, gaining a user base, and finding collaborators are potential outcomes.<br />
<br />
I don't want to simply advertise on these channels. Instead, I intend to provide value to address challenges participants face. By demonstrating value, the community for the Physics Derivation Graph grows. If the PDG doesn't provide value, then I shouldn't expect a community to develop.<br />
