<H1>The Physics Derivation Graph is for workflow management</H1>

<P><small>Published 2018-07-12T01:26:00.002Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

There's no complicated math underlying the&nbsp;Physics Derivation Graph. The code base is primarily about tracking numeric indices and strings in Python dictionaries and lists read from plain text CSVs.<br />
<br />
Similarly, there are no fancy algorithms in the software.<br />
<br />
The lack of complicated math and fancy algorithms is because the&nbsp;Physics Derivation Graph is for workflow management of mathematical Physics. Encoding the logic and processes is merely management of simple data (numerical indices, strings to represent math).
