<H1>proprietary code and data -- interacting with commercial projects</H1>

<P><small>Published 2017-07-08T00:14:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

There are two aspects to a project like the Physics Derivation Graph that could be&nbsp;proprietary: the data, and the software which manipulates the data.<br />
<br />
One motivation for protecting these aspects of a project are to make money. I'm not seeking money.<br />
Another motivation for protection is to ensure citation when the project is used. I apply the Creative <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a> to the Physics Derivation Graph project.<br />
<br />
I want to enable other people, including commercial efforts, to benefit from use of both the data and software I create. I also share the syntax of the data format so that future contributions from others can adhere to the data I already have. A published syntax standard also enables writing parsers for translation of the data format.
