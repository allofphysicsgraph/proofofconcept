<H1>finding cranks using the Physics Derivation Graph</H1>

<P><small>Published 2017-07-06T00:36:00.001Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

One of the applications of the Physics Derivation Graph would be to detect cranks. Existing methods include <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html">crackpot scoring</a>, proposed by John Baez. Gerard 't Hooft provides <a href="https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/theoristbad.html">an outline and description of bad theorists</a>.<br />
<br />
There's plenty of content which smells of crackpots, ie <a href="http://atomicprecision.com/OmniaOpera/omnia-opera-655.pdf">http://atomicprecision.com/OmniaOpera/omnia-opera-655.pdf</a><br />
<br />
The Physics Derivation Graph enables a more rigorous approach for identifying both mathematical steps and assumptions.
