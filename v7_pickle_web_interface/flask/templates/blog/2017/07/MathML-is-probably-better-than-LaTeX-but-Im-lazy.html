<H1>MathML is probably better than LaTeX, but I'm lazy</H1>

There's a good <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/XML/tutorial/MathML.html.en">overview of MathML</a> provided by Wolfram. MathML interacts with Mathematica, both for import and export.&nbsp;<div>

<div>
"MathML comes in two types: Presentation MathML, which describes what an equation looks like, and Content MathML, which describes what an equation means. By default, <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/misc/faq.html">MathJax</a> works with Presentation MathML and offers an extension for Content MathML."&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
There are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mathtowebonline.com/">online tools</a> that enable conversion of LaTeX (mathematics) to Presentation MathML.</div>

MathML is probably the better format to store data in the Physics Derivation Graph compared to Latex. However, Latex is more convenient for me as a data entry method.&nbsp;</div>
