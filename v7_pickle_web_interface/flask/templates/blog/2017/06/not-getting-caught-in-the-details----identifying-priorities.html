<H1>not getting caught in the details -- identifying priorities</H1>

There are lots of relevant topics with the Physics Derivation Graph:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>representing expressions prettily -- ie Latex, MathJax, MathML (presentation)</li>
<li>storing expressions meaningfully -- ie an Abstract Syntax Tree, MathML (content)</li>
<li>converting between presentation and content</li>
<li>converting between non-propriatry content representation and a Computer Algebra System</li>
<li>finding a Computer Algebra System capable of handling most of mathematical physics</li>
<li>manually creating content (ie actual derivations)</li>
<li>entering content manually into the Physics Derivation Graph</li>
<li>searching for content (ie PDFs of derivations)</li>
<li>converting found content (ie PDFs) to input for the Physics Derivation Graph</li>
<li>checking the consistency of content in the Physics Derivation Graph</li>
<li>rendering the content of the Physics Derivation Graph, ie using d3js or GraphViz</li>
</ul>
<div>
There are dependencies among these tasks. Also, there is an order for the tasks. Below I group and order the tasks.&nbsp;</div>

Getting content is vital to the Physics Derivation Graph being useful.&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li>manually creating content (ie actual derivations)</li>
<ul>
<li>entering content manually into the Physics Derivation Graph</li>
</ul>
<li>searching for content (ie PDFs of derivations)</li>
<ul>
<li>converting found content (ie PDFs) to input for the Physics Derivation Graph</li>
</ul>
</ul>

Before entering content into a computer, it makes sense to choose how to store the data</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>representing expressions prettily -- ie Latex, MathJax, MathML (presentation)</li>
<li>storing expressions meaningfully -- ie an Abstract Syntax Tree, MathML (content)</li>
<ul>
<li>converting between presentation and content</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div>
Once content exists, it would be useful to validate</div>
<ul>
<li>checking the consistency of content in the Physics Derivation Graph</li>
<li>finding a Computer Algebra System capable of handling most of mathematical physics</li>
<ul>
<li>converting between non-proprietary content representation and a Computer Algebra System</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div>
Lastly, but no less important, how will consumers interact with the data?</div>
<ul><ul></ul>
<li>rendering the content of the Physics Derivation Graph, ie using d3js or GraphViz</li>
</ul>
