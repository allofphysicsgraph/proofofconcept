  The visualization of a graph with expressions and inference rules as nodes relies on each node having a distinct index.

<H2><a name="how to navigate the codebase">How to navigate the codebase</a></H2>

<P>
  Much of the current codebase is focused on managing the numeric IDs
  associated with every facet of the database.
  This workload is due to not using a property graph representation (e.g., Neo4j).
  If I used Neo4j, I wouldn't need to track all the IDs and I could instead just work with the data.
  I've decided to stick with JSON and managing numeric IDs since I won't
  want to use proprietary software. (Neo4j community edition is open
  source, but I'm wary of the ties to a commercial product.)

<P>
  After checking out the github repo, I navigate to
  <code>proofofconcept/v7_pickle_web_interface/flask</code> and then run
  <code>make dockerlive</code> and then open Firefox to <code>https://localhost:5000</code>.<BR/>
  The purpose of this section is to address the question,  <em>What happened when that docker container ran and the webpage was opened?</em><BR/>
  Understanding the answer relies on knowing Python, <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a>, and the Model-View-Controller paradigm.

<P>
  The entry point for the program is <code>controller.py</code>.
  That file primarily depends on <code>compute.py</code>.
  The purpose of <code>compute.py</code> is to manage the Python dictionary of nested dictionaries in the variable <code>dat</code> that is read from the JSON file.
  All the additions, edits, and transformations to <code>dat</code> are performed in <code>compute.py</code> and then provided to <code>controller.py</code> for use in dynamically generating the HTML+Javascript pages using Jinja2.

<P>
  The starting point of <code>controller.py</code> is at the bottom of the file with the line <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code>.
  That is where the Flask app is started. Once the app is running, the web browser requests use the function decorators like <code>@app.route("/",...)</code> to run corresponding functions like <code>def index():</code>.
  Each of the decorated Python functions in <code>controller.py</code> rely on functions defined in <code>compute.py</code>.
  All of the calls from <code>controller.py</code> to <code>compute.py</code> are wrapped in <code>try/except</code> clauses so that if the Python fails, the user is not exposed to the failure stack trace.
  Each of the decorated Python functions in <code>controller.py</code> terminate with either <code>return render_template(...</code> or <code>return redirect(...</code> which results in the user's web browser getting a new page of content.

<P>
  When errors occur, there's a Flask function <code>flash</code> used to convey the error summary to the user (displayed at the bottom of the webpage).

  with the URL string. The Python flask package uses the URL information to
  call the relevant Python function. For example, requesting <code>list_all_derivations</code>
  invokes the function <code>def list_all_derivations():</code>. That
  Python function relies on functions in

<H2><a name="frequency period from first principles">Derivation of Graph from First Principles</a></H2>

<!-- this content is derived from
     https://allofphysicsgraph.github.io/proofofconcept/site/how_to_build_the_physics_derivation.html
-->

<P>
  A reasonable question is, "Why is the Physics Derivation Graph complicated?"
  To answer that, let's walk through the process of creating a derivation.
</P>

<P>
  A simple derivation is the transition from the expression \(T = 1/f\) to \(f = 1/T\), the same example used on the <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">home page</a>.
  The purpose of this section is to explain how a graph relates to the steps associated with this math.

<P>
  The steps needed to make the transformation are to multiply both sides by \(f\), then divide both sides by \(T\).
  There are four steps in this derivation:
<OL>
<LI>declare initial expression \(T=1/f\)</LI>
<LI>multiply both sides of \(T=1/f\) by \(f\) to get \(T*f=1\)</LI>
<LI>divide both sides of \(T f=1\) by \(T\) to get \(f=1/T\)</LI>
<LI>declare final expression: \(f=1/T\)</LI>
</OL>
  This expansion to atomic steps is not typically documented.
  This expansion can be tedious for derivations, but it is necessary for validation of steps using a Computer Algebra System.
  As a recommendation, starting the derivation on paper and then expanding to atomic steps with inference rules is best done on paper.</P>

<P>
  The next step is to visualize this graph.
  When building a graph, there are three types of nodes: inference rules, expressions, and feeds.
  The graph will only have three types of directed edges:
<UL>
<LI>source:"inference rule", destination:"expression"</LI>
<LI>source:"expression", destination:"inference rule"</LI>
<LI>source:"feed", destination:"inference rule"</LI>
</UL>

<P>
  Although there is enough information present to generate a graph, the objective for the Physics Derivation Graph is to support more complex derivations and to link multiple derivations.
  In the Physics Derivation Graph the inference rule "multiply both sides by" may appear in multiple steps.
  The graph should not render multiple uses of the same inference rule as the same node.
  Multiple references to the same expression should be a single node.
  Therefore, an index which has a scope limited to the local derivation step is needed.
  This leads to the notion of a unique numeric index local to each inference rule.
  The local index for the inference rule is a unique identifier within a derivation step.</P>
</P>

<P>
  Another complication arises regarding the expressions.
  The usefulness of \(T = 1/f\) depends on what is reading the expression.
  Multiple readers of the expression can be expected: humans, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>, and Computer Algebra Systems (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Mathematica">Mathematica</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SymPy">Sympy</a>).
  This leads to the need for a unique identifier which is associated with the expression independent of the representation.
  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">Logic</a>, this unique identifier is referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering">Godel number</a>.
  Similarly, the "feeds" (here <em>f</em> and <em>T</em> need unique identifiers.
<P>

<P>To summarize the above points,
<UL>
<LI>each inference rule gets a local identifier</LI>
<LI>each expression gets a unique identifier</LI>
<LI>each feed gets a unique identifier</LI>
</UL>


<P>
  The expression index is the same across all derivations, whereas the local index is scoped to just the derivation step.
  Similarly, the inference rule index is specific to the derivation step.
</p>

<P>
  The inference rule needs the local index to build the graph.
  The expression needs a local index to build the \(\rm\LaTeX\) PDF.
</P>

<P>
  In addition to the inference rules and expressions, each \(\rm\LaTeX\) expression actually represents an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) composed of symbols.

<H4><a name="rdf">RDF/OWL</a></H4>

<P>
  The Physics Derivation Graph can be expressed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>.

<P>
  Each step in a derivation could be put in the subject–predicate–object triple form. For example, suppose the step is
<Pre>
Input 1: y=mx+b
inference rule: multiply both sides by
feed: 2
output 2: 2*y = 2*m*x + 2*b
</Pre>
Putting this in RDF,
<pre>
step 1 | has input | y=mx+b
step 1 | has inference rule | multiply both sides by
step 1 | has feed | 2
step 1 | has output | 2*y = 2*m*x + 2*b
</pre>
  While it's easy to convert, I am unaware of the advantages of using RDF.
  The Physics Derivation Graph is oriented towards visualization.
  SPARQL is the query language for RDF. I don't see much use for querying the graph.
  Using RDF doesn't help with using a computer algebra system for validation of the step.

<H2><a name="comparison:syntax">Comparison of Syntax Options</a></H2>

<P>
  Here methods of capturing mathematical syntax required to describe derivations in physics are compared.
  This survey covers \(\rm\LaTeX\), Mathematical Markup Language (MathML), Mathematica, and SymPy.
  For MathML, both Presentation and Content forms are included.
</P>


<P>
Although \(\rm\LaTeX\) is intuitive for scientists and is concise, it is a typesetting language and not well suited for the web or use in Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). Mathematica is also concise and has wide spread use by scientists, though its cost limits accessibility. Mathematica is also proprietary, which limits the ability to explore the correctness of this CAS
</P>

<P>
\(\rm\LaTeX\) is concise and is widely used in the scientific community. It does not work well for portability to other representations and is ill-suited for use by CAS. For the initial phases of development for the Physics Derivation Graph, portability and compatibilty with a CAS are not the priority. Since getting content into the graph is the priority, the Latex representation will be used.
</P>

<P>
  For this survey it is assumed that users cares about the learning curve, leveraging previous experience, how wide spread use in their community, speed, ease of input, presentation (rendering), ability to access content across devices, OS independence, ease of setup.
  To evaluate criteria relevant to users, including the ability to <a href="#quantitative comparison of syntax">manually input syntax</a>, the ability to <a href="#conversion of syntax">transform between representations</a>, and the ability to <a href="#correctness of derivations">audit correctness</a>.
</P>

<P>
  Use of a single syntax for the graph content is important. To illustrate why, consider the approach where each syntax is used for its intended purpose -- Latex for rendering equation, SymPy for the CAS, and MathML for portability. This introduces a significant source of error when a single equation requires three distinct representation. The manual entry could result in the three representations not being sychronized. Thus, a single representation satisfying multiple criteria is needed. If no single syntax meets all the needs of the Physics Derivation Graph, then the requirements must be prioritized.
</P>

<P>
This comparison is between syntax methods which do not serve the same purpose. Latex is a type-setting language, while Mathematica and SymPy are Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). The reason these approaches for rendering and CAS were picked is twofold: they are widely used in the scientific community and they address requirements for the Physics Derivation Graph.
</P>

<P>
We can ignore syntax methods which do not support notation necessary for describing physics. Example of this include <a href="#cite:ascii">ASCII</a> and <a href="#cite:html">HTML</a>. Storage of the generated content (essentially a knowledge base for all of physics) isn't expected to exceed a Gigabyte, so compactness in terms of storage isn't a criterion in this evaluation.

<H3><a name="test cases">Test Cases</a></H3>
<P>
  to demonstrate the variety of uses in distinct domains of Physics, a set of test cases are provided in this section. These cases are not meant to be exhaustive of either the syntax or the scientific domain. Rather, they are examples of both capability requirements of the Physics Derivation Graph and of the syntax methods.

<P>
  For Physicists comfortable writing journal articles in Latex or exploring ideas in Mathematica, these are natural syntax methods.

Wolfram Research offers the ability to convert from Mathematica expressions to MathML on their site <a href="http://www.mathmlcentral.com/Tools/ToMathML.jsp">www.mathmlcentral.com/Tools/ToMathML.jsp</a>.

A CAS typically produces output syntax such as Latex or MathML in a single format. However, there are often many ways to represent the same math,  equation \ref{eq:example_partial_derivative_representations}.

<H3><a name="correctness of derivations">Auditing the Correctness of Derivations</a></H3>


<P>
  Latex and Presentation MathML are intended for rendering equations and are not easily parsed consistently by a CAS. For example, scientists and mathematicians often render the same partial differential operation in multiple ways:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}F =
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\frac{\partial F}{\partial t} =
\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial t^2} =
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\dot{F} =
\frac{\partial \dot{F}}{\partial t} = \ddot{F}.
