<H2>About the project</H2>
<P><i>What is the status of the project?</i><BR>
As of July 2015, a single developer is actively contributing to the project in his spare time.</P>


<P><i>How to contribute to the Physics Derivation Graph?</i><BR>
If you are a physicist, mathematician, or logician of any type, feedback would be useful.<BR>
If you are a researcher in another field (biology, computer science, chemistry, linguistics, etc), do you think this approach applies to your field?<BR>
If you are a programmer and would like to review the code, comments are welcome. </P>

<P><i>How to contact the project owner?</i><BR>
Email is the best method: ben.is.located AT gmail.com
</P>

<H3>Scope</H3>
<P><i>What is the role of proofs in the Physics Derivation Graph?</i><BR>
The project documents the algebraic manipulations needed for Physics. 
</P>

<P>The Physics Derivation Graph does not include geometric arguments<BR>
The Physics Derivation Graph does not include textual explanations about why algebraic manipulations are being carried out.<BR>
The Physics Derivation Graph is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaum%27s_Outlines">Schuam's outline</a>, except it covers all known Physics and documents the relations between various governing expressions.<BR>
There are no automatic mechanisms for generating new content.<BR>
There are no new algorithms.<BR>
The Physics Derivation Graph is about documenting existing knowledge<BR>
The Physics Derivation Graph requires no research.<BR>
The Physics Derivation Graph does include boundary conditions and initial conditions.
</P>

<P>Blindly following mathematical manipulations of expressions does not necessarily lead to physically valid outcomes. 

<P>Expression index is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering">Godel number</a>

<H3>Audience</H3>
<P><i>Who is the audience for the Physics Derivation Graph?</i><BR>
Students, teachers, researchers
</P>

<P><i>How could the Physics Derivation Graph benefit students?</i><BR>
For physics students, this project could address questions like, "how much of what is known have I learned?" and "what else is there to learn?"<BR>
For math students, this project could address questions like, "when would I apply what I am learning?" and "what is this useful for?"
</P>

<P><i>How could the Physics Derivation Graph benefit teachers?</i><BR>
For physics teachers, this project could address questions like, "how much of what is known have I learned?" and "what else is there to learn?"<BR>
For math students, this project could address questions like, "when would I apply what I am learning?" and "what is this useful for?"
</P>

<P><i>How could the Physics Derivation Graph benefit researchers in Physics?</i><BR>
This project provides a very detailed explanation of how complex derivations are carried out. It also explicitly enumerates the assumptions necessary to perform derivations.
</P>

<P><i>How could the Physics Derivation Graph be differentiated from crackpot work?</i><BR>
The goal (documenting all known Physics) sounds crackpot-ish. The approach doesn't disallow crackpot statements -- checking derivation steps using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">computer algebra system</a> doens't prevent physically nonsensical conclusions.<BR>
The purpose of the Physics Derivation Graph is to document known knowledge. No new knowledge is expected.
</P>

<H2>About the Physics Derivation Graph</H2>
<P><i>What is the output of the Physics Derivation Graph?</i><BR>
The output can is typically a graph visualization or a PDF of the same content in a linear text format. 
</P>

<P><i>How can the Physics Derivation Graph be visualized?</i><BR>
The graph output can be visualized in a web browser, a static GraphViz output, and other formats. 
</P>

<P><i>How can the Physics Derivation Graph be checked?</i><BR>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">computer algebra system</a> can be used to verify that each inference rule has been applied correctly to input and output expressions. 
</P>

<P><i>How is the content stored?</i><BR>
The expressions, symbols, and connections are each stored in XML format. This decision was based on a comparative analysis of other options, including MathML and Mathematica.</P>

<P><i>What subfields of Physics is this project capable of including?</i><BR>
Anything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics">Classical mechanics</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_quantum_field_theory">Topological quantum field theory</a> should be capable of being included. 
</P>

<P><i>Can the Physics Derivation Graph be used to prove Physics?</i><BR>
No. "Proof" is not a well-defined term in Physics. <BR>
From a Stack Exchange <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/82493/how-important-is-mathematical-proof-in-physics">answer</a>,<BR>
Mathematical proofs relate to exactly how a MODEL will behave. They don't have much to do with how the real world behaves. If the mathematics is carried out correctly, then one has "proven" how the model will behave.<BR>

The reason for experimentation, is to find out if the completely fictional MODEL that somebody simply made up, behaves in any way the same, as observations suggest the real world behaves. If it doesn't, that is not an indication of a mathematical error, it simply means the fictional model is not a good description of the real world, and must be changed.
</P>

<P><i>Does this approach apply to other fields?</i><BR>
There is not clear application of the concepts used in the Physics Derivation Graph to other fields (ie chemistry, linguistics, economics, mathematics, etc). 
</P>

<H2>Comparison of the Physics Derivation Graph with other projects</H2>
<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia<a/>?</i><BR>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia<a/> is text-based with hyperlinks. <BR>
In contrast, the Physics Derivation Graph is effectively language-independent.
</P>

<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Principia_Mathematica</a>?</i><BR>
The ambitious effort of Whitehead and Russell to prove the foundations of mathematics is not similar to this project. "Proof" doesn't apply in Physics. This project is about documenting existing knowledge in a format which can be parsed by computers. 
</P>

<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than <a href="http://equationmap.com/">Equation Map<a/>?</i><BR>
</P>

<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than <a href="https://www.symbolab.com/">Symbolab</a>?</i><BR>
</P>

<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">HyperPhysics</a>?</i>
<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">HyperPhysics</a> is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia<a/>in that it is text based for edges. <BR>
<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">HyperPhysics</a> has what appears to be a graph (hand drawn), but is actually a multi-level tree -- a concept diagram. For example, content in the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html#mechcon">Classical Mechanics subpage</a> does not link to any other subject. <BR>
The number of levels can vary. For example, the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html">main page</a> links to <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html#mechcon">mechanics</a> links to <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/colcon.html">Collisions</a> links to
<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mom.html#mom">Momentum</a>.
</P>

<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>?</i><BR>
<a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> is a commercial product, whereas the Physics Derivation Graph is open source.<BR>
<a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">computer algebra system</a>, whereas the Physics Derivation Graph is documentation of known mathematical physics relations.
