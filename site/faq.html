<H2>About the project</H2>
<P><i>What is the status of the project?</i><BR>
As of July 2015, a single developer is actively contributing to the project in his spare time.</P>

<P><i>Who is the audience for the Physics Derivation Graph?</i><BR>
Students, teachers, researchers
</P>

<P><i>How could the Physics Derivation Graph benefit students?</i><BR>
For physics students, this project could address questions like, "how much of what is known have I learned?" and "what else is there to learn?"<BR>
For math students, this project could address questions like, "when would I apply what I am learning?" and "what is this useful for?"
</P>

<P><i>How could the Physics Derivation Graph benefit teachers?</i><BR>
For physics teachers, this project could address questions like, "how much of what is known have I learned?" and "what else is there to learn?"<BR>
For math students, this project could address questions like, "when would I apply what I am learning?" and "what is this useful for?"
</P>

<P><i>How could the Physics Derivation Graph benefit researchers in Physics?</i><BR>
This project provides a very detailed explanation of how complex derivations are carried out. It also explicitly enumerates the assumptions necessary to perform derivations.
</P>


<P><i>How to contribute to the Physics Derivation Graph?</i><BR>
If you are a physicist, mathematician, or logician of any type, feedback would be useful.<BR>
If you are a researcher in another field (biology, computer science, chemistry, linguistics, etc), do you think this approach applies to your field?<BR>
If you are a programmer and would like to review the code, comments are welcome. </P>

<P><i>How to contact the project owner?</i><BR>
Email is the best method: ben.is.located AT gmail.com
</P>

<H2>About the Physics Derivation Graph</H2>
<P><i>How can the Physics Derivation Graph be visualized?</i><BR>
</P>

<P><i>How can the Physics Derivation Graph be checked?</i><BR>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">computer algebra system</a> can be used to verify that each inference rule has been applied correctly to input and output expressions. 
</P>

<P><i>How is the content stored?</i><BR>
The expressions, symbols, and connections are each stored in XML format. This decision was based on a comparative analysis of other options, including MathML and Mathematica.</P>

<P><i>Can the Physics Derivation Graph be used to prove Physics?</i><BR>
No. "Proof" is not a well-defined term in Physics. 
</P>

<P><i>Does this approach apply to other fields?</i><BR>
There is not clear application of the concepts used in the Physics Derivation Graph to other fields (ie chemistry, linguistics, economics, mathematics, etc). 
</P>

<H2>Comparison of the Physics Derivation Graph with other projects</H2>
<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia<a/>?</i><BR>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia<a/> is text-based with hyperlinks. 
</P>

<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than <a href="http://equationmap.com/">Equation Map<a/>?</i><BR>
</P>

<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than <a href="https://www.symbolab.com/">Symbolab</a>?</i><BR>
</P>

<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">Hyper Physics</a>?</i><BR>
</P>

<P><i>How is the Physics Derivation Graph different than <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>?</i><BR>
<a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> is a commercial product, whereas the Physics Derivation Graph is open source.<BR>
<a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">computer algebra system</a>, whereas the Physics Derivation Graph is documentation of known mathematical physics relations.
