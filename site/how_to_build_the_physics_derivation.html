<H2>How to build the Physics Graph</H2>

<p>A simple "derivation" is the transition from the expression <i>T</i>=<i>1/f</i> to <i>f</i>=<i>1/T</i> as presented on the <a href="../index.html">front page</a>. The purpose of this documentation is to explain how to build a graph<!-- using GraphViz, d3js, and a PDF in Latex-->.</p>

<P>The first step is to perform the derivation in atomic steps. To express frequency as a function of period, multiply both sides of the expression <i>T=1/f</i> by <i>f</i> to get a new expression, <i>T*f=1</i>. Then divide both sides of the second expression by <i>T</i> to yield the third expression, <i>f=1/T</i>. Even this "simple" expansion to atomic steps is not standard practice -- I haven't seen this done anywhere else. For most derivations, this is burdensome process. </P>

<P>The next step is to visualize this graph. I usually do this iteration by hand on paper.<BR>

This graph could be represented by the following pairs in a CSV
<FONT FACE="Courier New"> 
"T=1/f",multbothsidesby<BR>
"f",multbothsidesby<BR>
multbothsidesby,"T f=1"<BR>
"T f=1", dividebothsidesby<BR>
dividebothsidesby,"T"<BR>
dividebothsidesby,"f=1/T<BR>
</FONT>

<P>However, for larger derivations, a conflict arises. The inference rules can be referred to more than once -- ie "multbothsidesby" can be used in different steps of a derivation. Since we want the graph to have more than one node with the same label, an index which has a scope limited to the derivation step is needed. This leads to the notion of a "temporary index" for each inference rule. The temporary index for the inference rule is a unique identifier within a derivation step.</P>

<P>A second complication arise regarding the expression. In the above example, I use a human readable expression, ie "T=1/f". This usefulness of this format depends on what is reading the expression. The expression needs to be readable by humans, LaTeX, and Computer Algebra Systems (ie Mathematica, Sympy). A unique identifier is needed which is associated with the expression, independent of the representation. In Logic, this is referred to as the Godel number. Similarly, the "feeds" (here <i>f</i> and <i>T</i> need unique identifiers.<P>

<P>With the above constraints in mind, the CSV format is now of the form<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New"> 
"frequency and period",2,"expression",8482459,       3131111133,   "infrule",6822583,multbothsidesby<BR>

The columns are
<OL>
<LI>the name of the derivation</LI>
<LI>the step number within the derivation</LI>
<LI>the from node type</LI>
<LI>the from node temporary index</LI>
<LI>the from node permanent index</LI>
<LI>the to node type</LI>
<LI>the to node temporary index</LI>
<LI>the to node permanent index</LI>
</OL>

<P>The expression permanent index is the same across all derivations, whereas the temporary index is scoped to just the derivation step.<BR>
Similarly, the inference rule permanent index is consistent across the entire physics derivation project, whereas the temporary index is specific to the derivation step.</p>

<P>The inference rule needs the temporary index to build the graph.<BR>
The expression needs a temporary index to build the Latex PDF. </P>

<P>When building a graph, there are three types of nodes: inference rules, expressions, and seeds. To build a graph, we basically need a set of pairs. The pairs come from the 8 column CSV above. 
<UL>
<LI>If the node is an inference rule, use the temporary index (column 4 for "from", column 7 for "to"). </LI>
<LI>If the node is an expression, use the permanent index (column 5 for "from", column 8 for "to").</LI>
<LI>If the node is a feed, use the temporary index (column 4 for "from", column 7 for "to").</LI>
</UL>

<P>The graph will only have three types of edges:
<UL>
<LI>from:"inference rule" to:"expression"</LI>
<LI>from:"expression" to:"inference rule"</LI>
<LI>from:"feed" to:"inference rule"</LI>
</UL>
