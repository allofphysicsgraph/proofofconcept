<P>The snippets of SAGE can be run in <a href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">https://sagecell.sagemath.org/</a>

<P>The following carries out the actions of the derivation but does not explicitly use the inference rules:

<pre>
T,f=var('T,f')
expr= T == 1/f
expr=expr*f
expr=expr/T
print(expr)
</pre>
The output is
<pre>
f == (1/T)
</pre>
which is the expected outcome from the derivation.

<P>In contrast, the implementation below checks that the claimed step as stated by the inference rule is carried out correctly:

<pre>
T=var('T')
f=var('f')
# latex input: T = 1/f
input_expr = (1)/(f) == (T)
# latex output: T f = 1
expected_output_expr = T * f == 1
# latex feed: f
feed = f
input_expr * feed == expected_output_expr
</pre>
The output is
<pre>
True
</pre>
which means that the claimed step in the derivation was implemented consistent with the inference rule applied.
